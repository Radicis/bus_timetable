Initially implemented with screen scraping, i found the method lacking so experimented with another way.

Utilising a cross doman jquery script from James Padolsey. I am able to make ajax requests to their site and make a more convenient app than theirs.
I utilised requests to the bus eireann whensmybus website to pull down real time bus times to the app to display on my phone.

It is just implemented for 2 stops at present but if anyone is interested it can be expanded to add more.
